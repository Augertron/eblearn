  //! Create a new network based on a configuration.
  //! The configuration should at least contain these variables:
  //! 'net_type' which can contain so far 'cscscf', 'cscsc', 'cscf', etc.
  //! Other variables used are convolution and subsampling kernel sizes
  //! such as 'net_c1h', 'net_c1w', 'net_s1h', etc.
  //! See netconf.hpp for more details.
  //! 'in' and 'out' are used for memory optimization if not null, otherwise
  //! independent buffers are used in between each module (required for
  //! learning).
  //! \param in The input buffer for memory optimization.
  //! \param out The output buffer for memory optimization.
  // TODO: default is not allowed for function template,
  // solution is to use -std=c++0x or -std=gnu++0x but not available everywhere
