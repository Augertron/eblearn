    These are some notes that should help you get eblearn to compile
 and run on macos. They are based on revision 115 of the subversion
 source repository of the eblearn source.
    
Instructions

    * Install cmake
          o I installed from the src tarball (cmake-2.6.2.tar.gz)
          which you can get here at
          http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html.

          o Consult the README.txt in the top level directory and note
          that the steps to compile and install are "./bootstrap;
          make; sudo make install".

    * Install libatlas
          o I installed from the src tarball (Atlas-C++-0.6.1.tar.gz)
          which you can get here at
          http://sourceforge.net/projects/worldforge/

          o The standard "configure/make/sudo make install" will do. 

    * Install cppunit
          o I installed from the src tarball (cppunit-1.12.1.tar.gz)
          which you can get here at
          http://apps.sourceforge.net/mediawiki/cppunit/.

          o The standard "configure/make/sudo make install" will do. 

    * Install mnist databases
          o You get these here http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/.
          o You will need to unpack the data
          o You will need the full path to the data directory later on 
    * Install boost
          o You should be able to install from the most recent boost
          version. I found a "macports" version, which is much easier
          to install.

          o Macports install - If you don't have macports, use the
          tarball instructions here:
          http://www.macports.org/install.php. I installed from the
          tarball MacPorts-1.7.0.tar.gz.

          o Macports boost - cd into the macports bin directory and
          type ">> sudo ./ports install boost". This may take a
          while. 

    * Download and adjust eblearn build
          o Download from the subversion repository: ">> svn export
          https://eblearn.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/eblearn/trunk
          eblearn"

          o Modify the build to find boost headers. Locate the file
          "eblearn/scripts/FindBoost.cmake" and insert the line at the
          top of the file "SET(BOOST_INCLUDE_DIR
          /opt/local/include)". Assuming you did not change the
          default install directory of macports, then
          /opt/local/include will contain the macports versions of
          packages.

    * (??) Remove a problematic memcpy (??)
          o Edit the file "eblearn/eblearn/tools/src/DataTools.cpp"
          and locate the only instance of "memcpy" in that file and
          comment it. As far as I can tell its not used at all
          anyway. Including this line seems to corrupt memory
          somewhere and the boost directory iterator doesn't properly
          terminate, producing a seg fault. 

    * Build eblearn
          o At this point, you can use the standard instructions to
          build and configure eblearn

          o cd into the toplevel eblearn directory, and type
          ">>./clean.sh" (just in case you did a previous build with
          this src tree.)

          o Then type ">> ./build.sh".
          o Then type ">>./configure.sh". You'll need the full path to
          your local mnist data dir. 

    * Run unit tester
          o cd into "bin" and type "./eblearn_tester".
          o all the implemented unit tests should pass
