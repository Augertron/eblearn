     <h2>What is the eblearn project ?</h2>

     <p>
Eblearn is an object-oriented C++ library that implements various
machine learning models, including energy-based learning,
gradient-based learning for machine composed of multiple heterogeneous
modules. In particular, the library provides a complete set of tools
for building, training, and running convolutional networks.</p>

     <p>
In Eblearn, a learning machine is constructed by assembling modules.
Each module can be a functional module of a factor. Each module has at
least two methods: fprop, which computes the output(s) from the
input(s), and bprop, which computes the gradient of a loss function
with respect to the input(s) and internal parameters given the gradient
of the loss function with respect to the output(s). Functional modules
implement simple deterministic dependencies between inputs and outputs.
Factor modules implement non-deterministic dependencies between inputs:
the takes one or several input objects and output a scalar energy,
which can be interpreted as a negative log-likelihood. Factor modules
also have an infer method that produce the combination of unknown
inputs with the lowest energy. This design allows semi-automatic
differentiation of complex architectures for gradient-based learning,
as well as efficient MAP inference algorithms for factor graphs.
Eblearn uses a similar model and API as the machine learning library
distributed with the Lush language. All the trainable parameters are
collected in a single vector, which facilitates the implementation of
fancy optimization algorithms independently of the structure of the
learning machine.</p>

     <p> Eblearn implements convolutional
networks for invariant recognition of images and temporal sequences. It
implements all the known tricks to make gradient-based learning fast,
including the stochastic diagonal Levenberg-Marquardt method.</p>

     <p>
Eblearn also provides utility functions to preprocess images and access
and manipulate datasets. It comes with a portable GUI toolkit built on
top of Qt, which enables the graphic visualization of internal
variables and other data. The library has been used successfully to
train face detectors, and object recognizers.</p>

     <h2>Who are we ?</h2>
     <p>
The Eblearn project is currently under development at the Computational
and Biological Learning Laboratory, New York University's machine
learning lab, led by Yann Lecun. You can find more about us on the <a href="http://www.cs.nyu.edu/%7Eyann/index.html" target="new_page">lab's homepage</a>.</p>

     <h2>Where can you find the project ?</h2>
     <p>
The project is still on pre-release version, so there is no pre-packed
version of the library. Still, you are welcome to visit the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/eblearn/" target="new_page">sourceforge page</a> and browse the <a href="http://eblearn.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/eblearn/" target="new_page">SVN repository</a>, where the project is updated very regularly at the moment.</p>
     <p>
     You can get the current source tree with the following command: <br>
     <code><b>
     svn co https://eblearn.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/eblearn/trunk  eblearn
     </b></code>
     <br>
