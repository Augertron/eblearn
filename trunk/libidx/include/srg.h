////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Srg: storage area for Idx data.

//! Srg is a container for arrays of data. It contains
//! a pointer to a dynamically allocated chunk of data,
//! a size, and a reference counter. Access structures
//! such as Idx, point to an Srg that contains the data.
//! Several Idx's can share an Srg allowing access to the
//! data in multiple ways. Whenever an Idx is created that
//! that points an Srg, the reference counter of that Srg
//! is incremented through the lock() member function.
//! When the reference counter is reaches 0, the Srg
//! is deallocated. An Srg must always be created with new,
//! and never created as an automatic variable. For that
//! reason, the destructor is private.
//! So, if compiling your code produces an error like
//! "Srg<T>::~Srg() is private", you mistakenly allocated
//! an Srg as an automatic variable instead of new.
template <class T> class Srg{

 private:
  //! number of allocated items
  intg size_;
  //! reference counter: tells us how many Idx point here
  int refcount;

  //! destructor: deallocates the data.
  //! This is automatically called when the
  //! reference counter reaches 0.
  //! The destructor is made private so that the compiler
  //! will complain if someone decide to create an
  //! Srg on the stack (as an automatic variable).
  //! An Srg must ALWAYS be created with new.
  ~Srg();

  Srg();

  //! allocate an Srg of size s
  Srg(intg s);

  //! return the size (number of items)
  intg size();

  //! change size to s. This must be used with extreme caution,
  //! because reducing the size of an Srg ma cause some Idx
  //! that point to it to access non-existent data.
  intg changesize(intg s);

  //! increase size of data chunk
  intg growsize(intg s);

  //! increase size of data chunk by a given step s_chunk
  intg growsize_chunk(intg s, intg s_chunk);

  //! decrement reference counter and deallocate Srg
  //! if it reaches zero.
  int unlock();

  //! lock: increment reference counter.
  //! This is called wheneve a new Idx is created
  //! on the Srg.
